# 1 Dyld Steps

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/937447974/Blog/master/Resources/2017011001.png)

1. Map all dependent dylibs, recurse 
2. Rebase all images
3. Bind all images
4. ObjC prepare images
5. Run initializers

## 1.1 Loading Dylibs

1. Parse list of dependent dylibs 
2. Find requested mach-o file 
3. Open and read start of file 
4. Validate mach-o
5. Register code signature
6. Call **mmap()** for each segment

### 1.1.1 Recursive Loading

1. All your app's direct dependents are loaded 
2. Plus any dylib's needed by those dylibs 
3. Rinse and repeat
4. Apps typically load 100 to 400 dylibs!
	- Most are OS dylibs
	- We’ve optimized loading of OS dylibs

## 1.2 Fix-ups

1. Code signing means instructions cannot be altered
2. Modern code-gen is dynamic PIC (Position Independent Code) 
	- Code can run loaded at any address and is never altered
	- Instead, all fix ups are in __DATA

### 1.2.1 Rebasing and Binding

1. Rebasing: Adjusting pointers to within an image 
2. Binding: Setting pointers to outside image

**Rebasing**

1. Rebasing is adding a "slide" value to each internal pointer 
2. Slide = actual_address - preferred_address
3. Location of rebase locations is encoded in LINKEDIT 
4. Pages-in and COW page
5. Rebasing is done in address order, so kernel starts prefetching

**Binding**

1. All references to something in another dylib are symbolic 
2. Dyld needs to find symbol name
3. More computational than rebasing
4. Rarely page faults

### 1.2.2 Notify ObjC Runtime 


1. Most ObjC set up done via rebasing and binding 
2. All ObjC class definitions are registered 
3. Non-fragile ivars offsets updated
4. Categories are inserted into method lists 
5. Selectors are uniqued

## 1.3 Initializers

1. C++ generates initializer for statically allocated objects 
2. ObjC +load methods
3. Run "bottom up" so each initializer can call dylibs below it
4. Lastly, Dyld calls main() in executable

## 1.4 Pre-main() Summary

Dyld is a helper program

1. Loads all dependent dylibs
2. Fixes up all pointers in DATA pages 
3. Runs all initializers

# 2 Improving Launch Times

## 2.1 Goals

1. Launch faster than animation
	- Duration varies on devices 
	- 400ms is a good target
2. Don’t ever take longer than 20 seconds
	- App will be killed
3. Test on the slowest supported device

## 2.2 Launch recap

1. Parse images
2. Map images
3. Rebase images
4. Bind images
5. Run image initializers 
6. Call main()
7. Call UIApplicationMain()
8. Call applicationWillFinishLaunching

## 2.3 Warm vs. cold launch

1. Warm launch
	- App and data already in memory
	- App is not in kernel buffer cache
2. Warm and cold launch times will be different
	- Cold launch times are important
	- Measure cold launch by rebooting

## 2.4 Measurements

1. Measuring before **main()** is difficult
2. Dyld has built in measurements
	- **DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS** environment variable 
		- Available on shipping OSes
		- Significantly enhanced in new OSes
		- Available in seed 2
3. Debugger pauses every dylib load
	- Dyld subtracts out debugger time 
	- Console times less than wall clock

## 2.5 Optimizing

### 2.5.1 Dylib Loading

1. Embedded dylibs are expensive
2. Use fewer dylibs
	- Merge existing dylibs
	- Use static archives
3. Lazy load, but...
	- **dlopen()** can cause issues 
	- Actually more work overall

### 2.5.2 Rebase/Binding

1. Reduce __DATA pointers
2. Reduce Objective C metadata
	- Classes, selectors, and categories
3. Reduce C++ virtual
4. Use Swift structs
5. Examine machine generated code 
	- Use offsets instead of pointers
	- Mark read only

### 2.5.3 ObjC Setup

1. Class registration
2. Non-fragile ivars offsets updated 
3. Category registration
4. Selector uniquing

### 2.5.4 Initializers

**Explicit**

1. ObjC **+load** methods
	- Replace with **+initiailize**
2. C/C++ `__attribute__`((constructor))
3. Replace with call site initializers
	- dispatch_once() dsfgsdfgsed
	- pthread_once() 3452342
	- std::once()

**Implicit**

1. C++ statics with non-trivial constructors
	- Replace with call site initializers 
	- Only set simple values (PODs) 
	-Wglobal-constructors
	Rewrite in Swift
 2. Do not call dlopen() in initializers 
 3. Do not create threads in initializers

# 3 TL;DR

1. Measure launch times with **DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS** 
2. Reduce launch times by
	- Embedding fewer dylibs
	- Consolidating Objective-C classes 
	- Eliminating static initializers
3. Use more Swift
4.  dlopen() is discouraged
	- Subtle performance and deadlock issues
